- **Deleting Multiple Images:** Multiple images can be selected and deleted, with clear visual indications for the selected images.

- **Setting Feature Image:** The featured image can be set by sorting, with the first image from the left-to-right direction initially set as the featured image.

- **User Experience:** The gallery is designed for a smooth and responsive user experience, featuring transitions and animations for a polished look and feel.
